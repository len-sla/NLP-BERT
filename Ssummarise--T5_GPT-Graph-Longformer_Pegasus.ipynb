Extractive Summarization: Extractive summarization involves selecting and extracting important sentences or phrases from the original text to create a summary. It doesn't involve generating new sentences. Common techniques for extractive summarization include ranking sentences based on importance scores (e.g., using TF-IDF, graph-based algorithms like TextRank or LexRank) and selecting the top-ranked sentences as the summary.\n","\n","2. Abstractive Summarization: Abstractive summarization aims to generate a summary by understanding the meaning of the original text and generating new sentences that capture the essence of the content. This approach involves natural language generation techniques and can be more flexible in terms of generating summaries that are not limited to exact sentence extraction.\n","\n","3. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): LSA is a statistical technique that represents documents and words as vectors in a high-dimensional space. It can be used for extractive summarization by identifying the most important sentences based on their semantic similarity to the overall document.\n","\n","4. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): LDA is a topic modeling technique that assumes each document consists of a mixture of topics. It can be applied to summarization by identifying the most representative topics in the document and selecting sentences that best cover those topics.\n","\n","5. Graph-based Methods: Graph-based methods, such as TextRank or LexRank, treat the sentences of a document as nodes in a graph and use edge weights to represent the similarity between sentences. By applying algorithms like PageRank, these methods can identify the most important sentences as the summary.\n","\n","6. Neural Network Architectures: Apart from transformer-based models like T5 and GPT, various neural network architectures have been used for summarization, including sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n","\n","The choice of summarization method depends on the specific requirements of your task, the amount of training data available, the desired level of extractiveness or abstractiveness, and the computational resources at your disposal. Each method has its strengths and limitations, and it's often beneficial to explore and experiment with different approaches to find the most suitable one for your particular use case. following notebook  presents Graph based method and neuralarchitecture GPT and T5"],"metadata":{"id":"-8ohrCP3jCp8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Sure!

For instance, our laboratory has shown that particular forms of stress change our telomeres, which are a component of the genetic machinery of our cells that impacts how quickly our cells and therefore we age. We also discuss exciting work from Dr. Apple's laboratory, exploring how stress impacts our behavioral choices, in particular, which foods we elect to eat and how we experience those foods. You'll also learn about several important stress interventions that Dr. Eppel's laboratory has explored, including meditation and breath work, can profoundly influence the way that stress impacts your brain and body, both for better or for worse. By the end of today's episode, I assure you you will have a much more thorough understanding of what stress is and how it changes our biology and psychology, as well as the specific stress interventions that are going to be most optimal for you in reducing the negative effects of stress on the aging process and on negative behavioral choices, and also how to leverage stress in that stress can have on cellular metabolism, mental health, physical health, and performance. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. Thesis makes custom neutropics. Well, they have formulas that can put your brain into a state of increased clarity or focus or creativity or that can give you more overall energy for things like physical exercise. You'll take a brief three minute quiz, and thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month. Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep. \n","S 2s: So it's very important that you control the temperature of your sleeping environment, which also includes the temperature of your mattress. Despite not following a ketogenic diet, I make it a point to increase my blood ketones through the use of ketone IQ. The reason for that is that ketones are one of the brain's preferred sources of fuel. So if you'd like to try ketone IQ, go to hvmn.com and use the code Huberman to get 20% off your order. Again, that's hvmn.com and use the code Huberman to get 20% off. You know, we hear stress, stress is bad, stress can kill us, no one likes to feel stressed, etc. So, we love for you to just educate us a bit on what stress is and what it isn't, where it can be problematic and where perhaps it can even be beneficial. And you know, technically it just means anytime we feel overwhelmed that we feel like the demands are too much for our resources. And so it really comes down to not the stressors or what's happens to us, but really how we respond, the stress response. So that's a distinction that we're still trying to get the field to talk about stress in a more specific way so that we can think about, well what situations are in your life? \n","S 3s: Since you have now told us that our thoughts are the biggest sort of propagator of internal stress, what to your knowledge is the best way or what are the best ways for us to manage overthinking and ruminating on stressful topics? But when we succumb to stress, and the thinking patterns take over where the gears are turning and they won't stop turning, what does the science tell us about ways to manage those thoughts? So one is we, well, I'll just say first of all, we have to have some awareness of how our mind works or we're just like, you know, a subject to thinking our thoughts are real, thinking that it's helpful to keep ruminating and problem solving because that's our tendency is to go toward whatever we think there's threat or risk and to problem solve that. But that's where we are as a society. Yeah, so I think that, We come with different levels of awareness of our stress. And so when I find someone who really doesn't feel a lot of stress, sometimes I can see right through that and they're just not aware. I mean, one of the big patterns in the population levels of stress is that The older people are less stressed period. So we do, we don't have to wait till we get older, but there certainly is true wisdom and resilience that comes with age for many people. We're just used to it And so we're going through the day with kind of like clenched hands and just you know for listeners just even just taking a check in now and noticing How you might be holding stress in your body. So, going back to this notion of overthinking, what are the tools that are most efficient when people just can't seem to let go of the thing that's the stress or thinking about, not the stress in their body, but the thing that caused the stress, the difficult conversation, the thing that irked them on social media or in their personal life or professional life, or simply out in the world. \n","S 4s: s, since our beliefs and mindsets can really help us release stress, use stress more possibly. Yeah, I like the idea of having a small physical space or I suppose it could be a large physical space, but for most people who don't have the resources, some small pre-designate physical space that represents a safe zone. If you would be so kind as to just give us an overview of the different forms of stress, how we can learn to recognize those. talking about some of the work that you've been doing on stress and stress related eating and stress and how it relates to aging in particular. But before we do that, to make sure everyone's on the same page, if you could just pepper our minds with knowledge about stress in all its beautiful and not so beautiful forms. So when we think about stress, we usually think Also important, it's not always related to our mind. So measuring levels of the nervous system and how vigilant we are is another way that we can understand stress. We're not a report stress, but we're still holding tension and being much more sympathetically dominated, meaning that our body is vigilant and scanning for cues and we don't feel safe. mobilizing a lot more energy than we need to and Stress is so expensive to the body the stress response uses a tremendous amount of Energy ATP that's made by your mitochondria and if we have that kind of vigilant stress response on all day We're just going to feel exhausted and we all feel exhausted at the stage of the kind of long shot over the pandemic And it's really no mystery because we're not good at turning the stress response off We're going to really focus on this understanding. And you know, there's the breathing strategies I'm right with you where those are the most stress in the body, period. \n","S 5s: Like I can't suddenly just change my rate of digestion because I decide to, but we can do that with breathing. Not all of us, but many of us have those in our life. And so that's a really important strategy for people who feel like their life is going to be stressful forever because of X or Y. You're going to do more coping, but you can actually and stress in ways that it's not going to take that toll on your body. I mean, I study chronic stress and how it accelerates cell aging. is that there's a big landscape of discussion around aging and stress for us to cover. And since a lot of people are listening, not watching, and we don't use visual diagrams for that reason, I'll try and explain this as best I can. No stress is not the answer, rather to have some stress as ideal if you want to have so-called optimal aging. And why would it be that some stress is better than aging ideally. So having no stress means we're not really living like we're not engaging in the gifts of life which are inevitably have some challenge and risk. \n","S 6s: feeling like they were growing and they were feeling like their day had more meaning. And so they felt the stress of that. But they also saw how much they could help with their support And those who engaged in the program, particularly the men, actually had growth of their hippocampus during this program. Yeah, it's interesting that hippocampus, of course, a brain area involved in formation of memories. I think the most striking study to me is the one, and I should point out that most of the data say that the addition of new neurons is not the main reason for improvements in memory, but it is one of them. And they didn't die from the die injection, by the way, folks that died from other causes, they were terminally ill. And what they discovered was that even in terminally ill or or and some of these people were quite old, those people were still generating new neurons, especially in the context of still trying to learn and acquire new information. Are they not engaging in life? Are they really not having stressors? I almost have to wonder if it's like exercise where, you know, so many people, I think now everybody Thressing heart rate and brief muskah skeletal function and bone density, all that stuff. But that if you took a snapshot of the bodily response during exercise, blood pressure is way way up. \n","S 7s: And we know two things. So one is I do think that there is a level of engagement with moderate stressors that when we are used meaning we're less threatened by them. We can, two people can approach the exact same stressor, and one person is having a pretty over reactive stress response where they basically are feeling their survival is threatened. So it's high cortisol, high vasoconstriction, and blood pressure goes up equally in both, but the person who's feeling super threatened Their blood pressure went up because of the vasoconstriction. But to be really simplistic, two types of psychological stress response, feeling threatened, like you're going to fail, you're embarrassed. And then there's the challenge response, which is it's more of that kind of activated, excited response. And so when you asked about like, is it good to have a repeated stress response? I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to be the Health, our gut is very important. And it um, slash Huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road and the car on the plane, etc. \n","S 8s: And we just have to have a lot of self-compassion and awareness that, This is what I do. So when we want to shift from a Threatened response to a kind of challenge response. The whole trick here is that people need to find the strength statements, the stress shields, I call them, that fit them, that feels right, and that they believe. So it's needing to mount the stress response because it's so excited response. And so we can remind ourselves, be the lion. So there's all these strategies and you've got to use what works for you. Telling yourself, I got this, I can do it, I can get through it, I have what it takes. Those are all good shields. Like once we feel our heart racing, that leads to, oh no, you know, this is bad for me. So that reframing in studies by Wendy Mendez and others, my, my colleagues who do this re-appraisal research, they have basically trained people to view stress as positive during the stressful situations in the lab. \n","S 9s: And I think that's also a great opportunity for us to talk about the opioid system. content epidemic and all these people addicted to opioids and That's not really what this is about What we're about to talk about is the fact that we have an opioid system within us that is neurons and other cell types They can reduce Excuse me can release substances into our brain and body that make us feel less pain and make us feel sedated But at a healthy level, right? What is the relationship between stress and eating and eating and the opioid system? So most people, when they feel stressed, or I'm just going to ask you, do you or less when you're stressed. And what does the body feel like when you're in that stress state when you're not even hungry? I like to think I have that too, but okay, so I tend to mean more towards the sympathetic, meaning more alertness arousal on the seesaw of the autonomic nervous system. I look like a skeleton at the end, but that's not what most people or binge eating when they're emotional, when they're stressed. And so what it looks like is that the stress response is driving cravings. And it is a, um, what's hard about it is number one, it's very common and normative to just feel like us brings you to. And so what it means we measure this, it's very easy to measure, it means that people feel like they can't control their eating, they don't get full, they think about food a l \n","S 10s: We've studied it and maybe 50% of people with obesity have that. They get really compulsive. So we're really well wired to, if our body thinks we're under chronic stress, we're going to store stress fat or a done with fat so we can just mobilize that in a second. So I can tell you what we found there. Do we know a mistake of kind of confounding all obesity with food addiction and metabolic disease and it's completely heterogeneous. So I think it's the developmental path that you're describing, which is that there's a tendency toward having a bigger reward response and hunger during stress. And so some obese people have a regular stress response, but not all of them. Now, we want to know who has more of the compulsive eating type because they need a different set of skills to cope with stress and to lose weight if that's their goal. There's a drug, I'm sure you're familiar with Naltrexone, which can block the opioid receptor. Have people tried to use naltrexone in the context of binge eating and does it help people lose weight? \n","S 11s: I don't know if you're familiar with but right there's sort of all the rage. And one thing to think about is that the challenge that we all have, particularly for prone to obesity, is the toxic food environment, and particularly the refined sugar. And regardless of what we're on met, for men or one of these drugs, we overwrite it with our diet. Yes, and of helping people understand the big problem in the root is in the process food and the sugar and that the drugs don't touch that. So one is in our weight loss trials or our healthy mindful eating trials, we find that mindful eating is not going to cause a lot of weight loss period. And so in our trials, we find that if they, people with compulsive eating, if they get randomized to the mindful eating, they do better in terms of their insulin resistance and their glucose and their long-term weight loss. I always feel like behaviors should come first, do's and don'ts, then nutrition, then supplementation, and then if and only if it still needed prescription drugs. So anyway, that's my bias and at least for the time being, I'm sticking with it. I mean, the compulsive drive to eat is one of our strongest impulses if we've developed that pathway. And so, we train people, for example, in mindful awareness of separating out emotions from hunger. \n","S 12s: The problem is, as you know, is that the cravings get you to the buffet. So then we randomized half of them to get some extra boost, we caught motivational interviewing, where we're really supporting them more and helping them, you know, think of goals like being with our grandchildren not getting diabetes and that little bit of support you know, a big controlled trial, but at least 100 hospitals have adopted the stopped selling sugary drinks because people don't want to be sick, but they can't help it if they have the reward drive and if they have the complicity and it's right there at work, we're just working against health. I think that for most of us, we think about soda as the kind of thing that maybe we've had every once in a while or that we drank more when we were kids, appetite for soda. And you know, like what? And I know that some of my audience would just gasp, how could I do that? And I actually really like the taste of diet soda. like that. But if I have the choice between a really great coffee and the soda, it's going to be coffee or your bammate and a soda, it's going to be your bammate or food and soda. And so that's me. Also brings me the idea that drinking sugar in the form of liquid is one of the worst things \n","S 13s: It's, I don't want to use the words empty calories because it's kind of a loaded phrase, but it is essentially empty calories. And I don't know what, why there's maybe it's the packaging or how the marketing has been bitched. Do you think this is a reaction to how much stress people are experiencing? My guess is that it is part of a stress response, but even more than that, it's part of the hedonic cycle. And then you get the low, and it's the hedonic withdrawal, so which is this, you actually feel bad when it's been a while since you've had it. Now, let me tell you that when you asked is a sugary drink, one of the worst things we can do for our health. The view on sugar I think is starting to change and I think in the years to come, provided folks like you and Dr. Lustig continue to be vocal about it, which I hope you will. But the basic reality is, yeah, we're going to eat the donuts if they're in front of us. You know, I learned something interesting about smoking and why so few people now smoke. I always thought that the campaigns around smoking and how terrible it is for us, showing pictures of lungs that are, you know, caked with all this tar and like, you know, cancer and all this stuff was the effective message. \n","S 14s: And so I find it very interesting. Anytime there's something like soda or highly processed foods that are so woven into the establishment, it seems like though you can people until, you know, we're blue in the face about all the health concerns with with these things, you know, sugar is bad and this is bad, highly processed food is bad. This has been true for probably hundreds of thousands of years, but it's certainly true in the last hundred years and let them see that there is a very strong big food, It is working against them and that in order to take control of their health, actually, we want to activate their sense of rebellion so that they're like, no, I'm going to take excellent care of myself. I want the soda, but I'm not going to drink it. So, I don't know, maybe this is getting me back into my teenage mindset, but I think a sense of rebellion provided it's in the direction of health, one's own health, and the health of others, of course, can be a positive thing. We really, we have them bring in the chunkiest processed food they can think of, like a twinkie, and eat that really slowly and mindfully. of error that you've talked about where they think the brain is driving them to have it because of the advertising and their expectation that they'll feel good. Actually, like the 100% chocolate. It has, I think that was the first time I could actually taste the real elements of chocolate. Yeah, that is not reward. \n","S 15s: One major challenge with blood work, however, is that most of the time it does not come back with any information about what to do in order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, etc. Into the ranges that you want with inside tracker, changing those values becomes very straightforward because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use to address the nutrition based behavior based supplement based approaches that you can use in order to move those values into the ranges that are optimal for you, your vitality and your longevity. So while we're talking about stress, eating, obesity, and here we've also brought in the discussion to include different generations. findings run this study that you did of pregnant women and how stress and pregnancy and different patterns of eating and physiological changes that people experience during pregnancy. It's just not going to work. We wanted to do this with pregnant women excessive weight during pregnancy, which is not healthy for the mom or the offspring. The women in the control group gained about about 60% of them gained excess weight during pregnancy and same with our mindful group. There have been so many beautiful developments in the women who got the training that we just keep our being shocked by how impactful This reduction training was, it was just two months of their life, but pregnancy is a very critical period when these women were changing their habits and they were very motivated to help their baby. So here's what we found. And so it's like a pre-biabetes test. \n","S 16s: So we're talking about 10 minutes a day of meditation. We had them. I mean, we need all the reminders we can, you know, post it on the fridge, timers in our phone to do this mindful check-in. And so they were during the week doing this check-in and it was simply a mindful check-in closing their eyes and feeling their body, feeling their labeling their emotions. And then it was some movement. So it was mindful check-in, breathe, move my body. If we're not aware of where our mind is, we are just subject to the, you know, believing They're sticky thoughts. And then I think the breathing, as we talked about, is probably the more direct way that they're influencing the prenatal environment, the uterine environment, to reduce the stress that the baby's being exposed to. And the movement refocuses us from our mind and our ruminative thoughts to the experiences to what we feel in the body. that showed that overweight people with a lot of cravings, if they do the body scan, that's simply focusing on the body from the head to the toe, you know, just reminding ourselves to focus on each part of the body, breathe into it, release tension, it's very basic and simple. \n","S 17s: So I could think of one form of craving where, for instance, the donut, again, donuts for me, is in front of me and I'm thinking that I want that. And so I'm almost in complete extra reception, but I'm tethered to it. It's And then if I do a body scan, so I'm putting it myself in this experiment in a kind of hypothetical scenario, I'm putting myself into this experiment. And if so, you know, because I do think this is a remarkable result. I mean, they do, they literally drill down through the skull of people who have been cheating disorder and start stimulating different brain areas because these people are so out I mean, that's the kind of intervention that is considered necessary for a lot of folks who binge. So here you're telling me a body scan in some individuals can reduce that. Do you think that there are behavioral interventions that can be layered on top of body scans? You know, and some people are going to like that. It's going to be, you know, I think breaking that link that you talked about. You know, in the studies that we do in our laboratory, we get people for a month, they do one intervention, we swap them to another intervention, and you get a month, we analyze data, takes a couple of years to do all that, but we write papers and we move on. \n","S 18s: So that was our control group. And what we found from that study was that in the short run, a week later, everyone felt fantastic after the week, right? Yeah, well, so they did, they learned transcendental, sound primordial sound meditation, which is similar to TM, where you have a, you're focused attention on your, on a word, over and over, but there's also more awareness of couldn't say how many minutes a day, but it was on and off during the day. to a week is that? So you don't go right into a two week. You work up to it. So the longest I've ever done is a two week silent meditation retreat. But I think the short bouts every day are, that is what is the most important message for people, for managing daily stress. And that's in the stress prescription, it's very much about how we can do short daily nudges to reduce our stress arousal. Yeah, certainly it's not an either or, but it seems like nowadays a lot of the discussion that used to be had around meditation, its ability to evoke neuroplasticity and things of that sort has shifted over to an increased focus on psychedelics, the common theme on this podcast, but it just seems like in, you know, taking the \n","S 19s: pulse of social media and the landscape both in microdose and macrados and MDMA and some of the other trials that are out there that Many people are trying to forget the incredibly rich and vast literature supporting the use of even brief meditation practices for reshaping the mind So I'm glad that we're talking about meditation But I mean even going into Medicine experiences is enhanced if you have a little bit of training in how to experience with that much more kind of calmness, skill, and wisdom knowing this is just the mind doing this cool things. And then just as a little editorial on psychedelics, what's interesting I think about the clinical data is that, is a curve because it has all these properties of hallucinations and altered thinking, et cetera, that access kind of a gravitational pull around our ideas about what psychedelics do. and that's actually when most of the rewiring is happening, which I find really interesting, which is not unlike meditation, where, sure in one bout of meditation, you might see a adjustment or rewiring of the brain, but at least from the book, Altered Traits, which I'm a big fan of, talked about these daily repeated short meditations or these longer TM retreats, as they are sometimes called, in inducing this big time brain plasticity. All right, well, I'm now gonna have to do it, and I'll report back to everybody what my experience was, silently. I'd love to talk a little bit about some of the other health metrics that you've explored, not just in the context of mindfulness, but I'm particularly intrigued by a graph here. I think it's a fascinating study and I'm so glad you did it, but I'll let you tell us about it. Yeah, we've done these in-depth studies where we are looking at people under a lot of daily demand, caregivers, and then we look at normal people, parents of neurotypical children who still have a lot of stress. So Martin Picard, my colleague who has been obsessed with mitochondrial health as a pathway to understanding both stress and really health and disease. I mean, it's it really is a it was quite dramatic. But here's the beauty of that study. \n","S 20s: One of the things we know that matters for long-term health is how positive you feel at night. And in our study, it looks like the daily mood with a mitochondria level that same day. And we measured mood like, you know, days away from that and was much less correlated. So for those of us that find ourselves in a state of chronic stress, and here I'm talking about the kind of stress that you mentioned before, which is, There is unlikely to be a simple solution. I think that's the correct title. And they were talking about some of the misconceptions about radical acceptance because I think a lot of people hear the words radical acceptance. But what you're talking about is chronic stress of the that really the stress or the fact that a very close relative or family member is dealing with a lifelong condition or the fact that we can't extract ourselves from a situation, that we are not in full agency to remove the stress or that radical acceptance of that fact used to not just offset the negative health effects, but maybe even thrive in the context of this, essentially turning what initially was thought of as a curse into a blessing, at least biologically speaking. this game that we were born into and even just the idea that bad things shouldn't happen sets us up for vulnerability to feel victimized to feel like we can't you know accept bad things that have happened. And so just even taking that first kind of step back to get perspective on what are the in my life that stressed me out. Just that recognition of this isn't \n","S 21s: going to go away is incredibly powerful because we can, as I say, put the baggage down and give ourselves some relief and some freedom space it holds in our mind and in our body. Radical acceptance is something we practice over and over to help us loosen our grip on unwanted situations, on letting them control our well-being and taking up this mental real state. So I'm an expert at this because I have, I'm a caregiver. And I often need to refocus from wishing things were different, trying to solve things to really radical acceptance of this is how things are right now. We paint them and we say, in the last five minutes, how much have you been wishing things were different? And so some of the metaphors that I think are helpful for this are thinking of yourself, think of this unwanted situation, and think of how You're doing that because you care. And so I can be freed up to live in the ways that I do have control over, to do things that help around the edges. And so by dropping the rope for them meant realizing there were things they could do, being present, being loving, doing the little bit of care that they could from a distance, was all they could do. That's that loving presence is like a gift that we don't realize that we we always have that to give. It's kind of it. \n","S 22s: You don't just set that aside, say that was for childhood. And this is this is the theory, not just of Freudian psychology, but a kind of modern trauma and neuroscience informed trauma therapies. So I was just curious, again, I wasn't consulted the design phase and I'm assuming you weren't either, but you know what, I wonder what in us, as scientists I'm just kind of doing the Gidonkin experiment here, being compels us to try and change what we, the unchangeable. One is on certainty and one is on control. And these drive us crazy until we can somewhat master and understand how little control we have and how much uncertainty there is and will always be. So let me ask you this, if you couldn't plan your day tomorrow, know with certainty what your plans or what was going to happen, how much ease and relaxation would you feel at the not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow? I'm just the week, even when I was in school. I mean, is this like a fixed personality and we're Or is this something that we like a muscle that we can build? freedom that we can feel when we realize we don't control tomorrow. We just go with it and we, you know, we do our best and what delight there is in just viewing things with curiosity and just seeing what emerges. \n","S 23s: And that's just a way of saying, I am in a, you know, receptive mode and I'm going to And so I actually learn that on a meditation retreat because I tend to be type A and I leave a retreat going from like very relaxed to like that leaning forward tense of like where's the to-do list. And so carrying with me that posture of like just see let time unfold as it will without trying to control things. It gets right to the heart of something that I spend a lot of time thinking about in the stress management and also just general thriving, which is that I think that about half of the messages that we get relate to stress and mind-body interventions relate to adopting this forward center of mass. This idea of, okay, stress can give us early dementia, stress can limit Activate all sorts of positive anti-inflammatory pathways as well that the mindset matters and here I I'm doing a terrible job of it, but I'm trying to scrape off and capture the top contour of the beautiful work of my colleague Dr. Leia Crum who's yes You know down this podcast and is it a huge fan of her work as well and With that mindset matters because it shapes physiology For sure it her data point to that approaches. And then on the other hand, there are these stress mitigation techniques, both mental and physical body-oriented, mind-oriented, are they're not being back on your heels, so to speak, like letting things bulldoze you, but are more of this receptive mode and more of an awareness mode. And I think that since here we are at the table to researchers who focus on these issues a lot, do you think it's fair for us to adopt a sort of general framework and model that perhaps people but that having both of these in one's kit of tools could be valuable. I think of it as you muscle it and or you release it and we need both. And so that letting go is a really important wise, you know, discerning way to mitigate stress in the right situations in the right time. Like, I mean, we are in an ocean and we have small waves, we have big waves, some of these tidal And so when we're not in the middle of a wave, which is when we need to muscle it, we're between waves. We need to go the direction of the tide. \n","S 24s: Again, I'm fascinated by these because I think it's a category of stress that's not often talked about. And so, you know, what is the, you know, for people that are listening to this and that and want to start to adopt practices, do you think that spending some time creating a written or a spoken narrative is helpful? In stress research, it's not what happens to us. It's how we're interpreting it and how we're responding to it. And I've heard you say talked about what is stress. It's really what narrative we're creating around it. So I think a narrative of purpose, fill in the blank about what's meaningful to you, but that is why we're different than just the rats that we study or the monkeys. Like they have these amazing stress responses that are we have them too and we can't control that, but we have our purpose in life to see and know that we are going to die and we can have some control over how we live and maybe even how we die and how we want to be remembered. So for many years, I mean, I think my first paper when I was a graduate student with positive physiological stress. And instead for many, many too many years, I've been studying the dark side, toxic stress, trauma, caregiving, and how that is can take a toll on the body without the right resilience and resources. \n","S 25s: rom meditation and what I feel the biggest bang for the buck is you know if I'm super jittery with a big stress response because of X or Y, it is actually something like a hit type workout or taking the dogs for like a really brisk walk or like burning up that energy and my body is a very big effect size for me personally. Everyone has their, you know, different ways that they can see the biggest shifts in daily stress. I really had to. And then he heard about telomeres and he was like, I need to know if my method is affecting cell aging. So I gather and by the way know as a perfectly fine answer, I gather that you're not going to tell us about the whether or not there are telomere changes yet or maybe that's not possible. So what we're going to look at, we don't really think that telomers can change very quickly and telomere may. We can look at many different mechanisms and pathways with gene expression patterns, especially with these new kind of assays where you can look at, you know, some 1,000 different proteins like the somalogic. And I will tell you that while we're still preparing the results, there were very different profiles from the different interventions that make us think that there's a lot of specificity. Even though everyone feels better, the way that they got there is very different, the ways credible. And I have to say when I heard that you were studying Wim Hofmethed, I was positively delighted because I find that there are so few serious researchers in the realm of modern science that are both explorers and then take what they've gleaned from those explorations and then take it to the laboratory and put rigor on those and really try and parse mechanism with, of course, all the open-mindedness to whatever the outcome happens to be, right? \n","S 26s: I must say it's very refreshing and I think it's exactly exactly what the world needs right now in terms of tools for mental health and physical health because far too many studies try and isolate variables without understanding a larger context of like what are the different types of stressors and clearly you're addressing that or you know there's this thing breath work that some people might think oh you know the iceman Wim Hof it's really esoteric You say, well, what are the critical elements from that that we might be able to extract to understand this positive use stress phenomena? So I just I want to first of all just say thank you for doing the incredibly important work you do and thank you. I mean, we were so delighted to see the paper you did with David Spiegel and to know that you're pursuing this path and It's very reassuring with your rigor and your no depth of background.
